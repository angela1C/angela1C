### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a student in GMIT doing the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics.
- ðŸ¤” I previously worked in the financial services industry
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make interactive dashbaords and visualisations using Dash

My account contains several project repositories which I will outline here:

- **Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project_2020**
The Machine Learning and Statistics module provided an introduction to machine learning and the statistical aspects surrounding the theory.

The aim of this project was to create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions for the power output from wind turbines based on their wind speed values. 
I developed a polynomial regression model using `scikit-learn` and  an artificial neural networks model using `Keras -Tensorflow` using the dataset to make predictions of the expected power output given a particular wind speed value in a Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/angela1C/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project_2020/blob/a490e710f41ef352f2f814c66568047969e7dd4f/wind_project.ipynb).
The README in the repository outlines how to run the Flask web service application.


- **Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks-project-2020**
The Machine Learning and Statistics module provided an introduction to machine learning and the statistical aspects surrounding the theory.

This project involved solving several tasks to be completed in a single Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/angela1C/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks-project-2020/blob/0adb514fea6e8c7d49208d46c303ebf531aee6d0/Tasks.ipynb).  
  1: To write a Python function that calculates and prints the square root of two to 100 decimal places in plain Python without using any module from the Python standard library or otherwise.  
  2: Verifying a Chi-squared test statistic and calculating the p-value using SciPy.stats.  
  3: Perform a simulation using NumPy demonstrating that Excelâ€™s STDDEV.S calculation is a better estimate than its STDDEV.P calculation for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample.  
  4: Applying k-means clustering to a dataset using scikit-learn.  

- **Data-Representation-Project-2020**
The Data Representation module focused on  investigating and operating the protocols, standards and architectures used in representing data, with a focus on interacting with data services across the internet with  practical experience in developing applications that interact with such data.

The project for this module involved writing a Flask server program that consumes a REST API and creating a web interface. The project links to the Irelandâ€™s open data portal atÂ <https://data.gov.ie>, populates a MySQL database with some tables, then allows a user to interact with the data stored in the database through a web interface. It also allows the user to request additional data from the Irish open data portal using additional API actions.

- **Multi-Paradigm-Programming-Shop-Project-2020**
This module provided an introduction to various programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, functional programming and dataflow programming. 

The project consisted of writing code for a shop in both a Procedural style and an Object Oriented manner using C, Python and Java with the following requirements:  The program has a menu where the user can select to purchase items using a CSV file or live mode.  A customerâ€™s CSV file contains the customerâ€™s order  as well as their available budget. In live mode the customer can enter a product by name, specify the quantity and pay for it. The state of the shop is consistent. The program determines whether or not the shop can complete an order or if the customer has sufficient budget and updates the cash and stock in the shop. There are three versions of the shop application. The procedural version is written in both C and Python. The object oriented version can be written in Python (or Java). The live mode and input csv files has the exact same behaviours in all 3 implementations with identical user experience.
The project also included writing a report comparing the solutions achieved using the procedural approach and the object oriented approach.

- **Computational_thinking_with_algorithms_2020**
The aim of the Computational Thinking with Algorithms module was to provide a comprehensive grounding in solving computational problems and designing algorithms. 
In this project I reviewed various comparison and non-comparison sorting algorithms, describing how each algorithm works and considering concepts such as their time and space complexities, performance and stability. A simple diagram was created for each of the 5 chosen algorithms  to illustrate how each sorting algorithm works on a small input array. 
Bubble Sort and Inserting Sort were used as examples of the simple comparison-based sorting algorithms, Merge Sort and Quick Sort were used as examples of efficient comparison-based algorithms and Counting Sort as an example of a non-comparison based sorting algorithm. 
I then wrote a Python application to benchmark the 5 sorting algorithms discussed. The purpose of the benchmarking application was to take arrays of randomly generated integers of various sizes and to test the effect of the input size on the running time of each sorting algorithm. The times were measured and compared to each other and to the expected results given in other studies referenced. 


- **Web_Applications_Development_project_2019**
The Web Application Development  module provided an introduction to modern web application and network application development using frameworks in high-level programming and scripting languages. The focus was on building light-weight network services, particularly web-based services, and integrating those services with modern front-end frameworks. 

The final project for the module  involved creating a personal website using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the JavaScript library D3 for some basic visualisations. The website had several linked pages, a login screen for user validation and form validation. Users can access and change styling using the DOM. The use of events was demonstrated. The website included some data visualisations using D3. It is not the prettiest website but it did provide the opportunity to put into practice the core elements of the module. There was no requirement to host the website anywhere. Instead a simple Python web server was used and the files were submitted as a zip file. 

- **/Applied_Databases_project_2020**
This module provided a primer on databases with a focus on data analysis. CRUD ( Creation, Retrieval, Update and Deletion) of both structured and unstructured data for a number of modern database systems and architectures and included topics on Relational databases, NoSQL databases, databases interfaces and database logic.

The project for this module had 4 different sections:
Working with a relational database using MySQL - importing a World.sql database and writing queries to answer some questions.
Working with a non-relational database using MongoDb and writing some queries to satisfy some questions on a student and courses database.
Writing a Python application with a user interface to perform CRUD operations on both the relational and non-relational databases above
Discussing normalisation - examining a relational database to see whether it was a good or bad design in terms of normalisation.
