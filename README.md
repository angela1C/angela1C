### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I am a student in GMIT-  completing the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics programme.
Some of the projects for the course are contained in the following repositories.

- **Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project-2020**
A Flask web app that uses machine learning models to make predictions for the power output from wind turbines based on their wind speed values. 

- **Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks-Project-2020**
Four tasks to be completed in a single Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/angela1C/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks-project-2020/blob/0adb514fea6e8c7d49208d46c303ebf531aee6d0/Tasks.ipynb).  
 
- **Data-Representation-Project-2020**
A Flask web app with REST API. CRUD operations on a MySQL database. The application links to the Irish open data portal at <https://data.gov.ie> using the [CKAN](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/) APIs.

- **Multi-Paradigm-Programming-Shop-Project-2020**
The project consisted of writing code for a shop in both a Procedural style and an Object Oriented manner using C, Python and Java as well as a report comparing the solutions achieved using the procedural approach and the object oriented approach.

- **Computational-Thinking-With-Algorithms-Project-2020**
Benchmarking sorting algorithms in Python. Reviewing various comparison and non-comparison sorting algorithms, describing how each algorithm works and considering concepts such as their time and space complexities, performance and stability. 

- **Applied-Databases-Project-2020**
CRUD operations on a relational database (MySQL) and a non-relational database (MongoDB) as well as a discussion on normalisation.

- **Web-Applications-Development-Project-2019**
A simple website using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the JavaScript library D3 for some basic data visualisations. Linked pages and user login.

- **Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Simulation-Project-2019**
Simulating a dataset using Python's `numpy.random` module. I chose to simulate theÂ World Happiness Score, in particular the main determinants of happiness at country levels across the world as reported in the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report).

- **Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Random-Numbers-Project-2019**
Explaining the overall use of Pythonâ€™s `numpy.random package`and in particular the use of  its simple random data functions,  permutations functions and distributions functions as well as the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

- **Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2019**
Exploratory data analysis and regression analysis of the Tips dataset using the Python data science stack.

- **Programming-and-Scripting-Project-2019**
Researching Fisher's Iris dataset and exploratory data analysis of the dataset using the Python data science stack. 

- **Programming-and-Scripting-Problem-Set-2019**
A set of ten programming problems aimed at learning core Python skills including input and output from the command line, handling exceptions, dates and times, writing functions and control flow in Python, string methods, reading and writing files and basic plotting usingÂ Matplotlib.
