My account contains several project repositories which I will outline here:

- **Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project_2020**
The aim of this project was to create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions for the power output from wind turbines based on their wind speed values. 

- **Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks-project-2020**
Four tasks to be completed in a single Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/angela1C/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Tasks-project-2020/blob/0adb514fea6e8c7d49208d46c303ebf531aee6d0/Tasks.ipynb).  
 

- **Data-Representation-Project-2020**
The project for this module involved writing a Flask server program that consumes a REST API and creating a web interface. 

- **Multi-Paradigm-Programming-Shop-Project-2020**
The project consisted of writing code for a shop in both a Procedural style and an Object Oriented manner using C, Python and Java as well as a report comparing the solutions achieved using the procedural approach and the object oriented approach.

- **Computational_thinking_with_algorithms_2020**
Reviewing various comparison and non-comparison sorting algorithms, describing how each algorithm works and considering concepts such as their time and space complexities, performance and stability. Writing a benchmarking application in Python.

- **Web_Applications_Development_project_2019**
A personal website using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and the JavaScript library D3 for some basic visualisations. 

- **/Applied_Databases_project_2020**

Working with a relational database (using MySQL) and a non-relational database (using MongoDb) as well as a discussion on normalisation.

- **Programming-and-Scripting-Project_2019**
